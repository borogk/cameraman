# Chapter 4.3 - Bezier mode

_**Note** - make sure you've read [Chapter 4.1 - Linear mode](ch04.01.linear.md) first! It explains a few base concepts which won't be explained here._

### Defining parameters

Bezier mode makes the camera follow a [quadratic Bezier spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Quadratic_B%C3%A9zier_curves):

The path's shape is controlled by 3 points:
- `X0, Y0, Z0` define a curve beginning
- `X1, Y1, Z1` defines a middle control point, which bends the curve
- `X2, Y2, Z2` define a curve end

The further you move the middle control point away from `X0, Y0, Z0` - `X2, Y2, Z2` line, the more extreme the curve will be.

### Camera angle

**A0** and **A1** parameters set the camera angle in the start and in the end.

Regarding angle modes:
- In **Relative** angle mode the value of `0.0` turns with the curve and points towards tangent
- In **Absolute** angle mode the value of `0.0` always points East

In both cases, angles increase counter-clockwise.

### Camera pitch

Pitch is controlled by **P0** and **P1** parameters the same way as for the [Linear path](ch04.01.linear.md).

### Camera speed

**Distance** speed mode is not supported by the Bezier mode. Camera will always move as if the **Time** mode is selected.

**Time** speed mode works the same as for the [Linear path](ch04.01.linear.md).

### Drawing interactively

To draw a Bezier path interactively, follow these steps:
1. Make sure the draw mode is set to `Bezier`
2. Point the cursor at the start point and press `[Use cursor]`
3. Move the cursor to the end point and press `[Use cursor]` again
3. Move the cursor to the middle control point and press `[Use cursor]` again

This is what you should see in the end:

### Tips and tricks

- **Relative** angle mode can produce jittery results, try adapting to **Absolute** mode instead
- Bezier can be a convenient substitute for drawing an arc in Radial mode
- Keep in mind, Z axis values also matter to the curve shape
- To have a better look at the preview while drawing, use cursor lock feature
