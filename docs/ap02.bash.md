# Appendix B - Usage with bash

**Cameraman** mod functions in part thanks to several **PowerShell scripts**:
- cm-editor.ps1
- cm-player.ps1
- cm-settings.ps1

Additionally, the mod package includes bash scripts.
- cm-editor.sh
- cm-player.sh
- cm-settings.sh

These scripts mimic the same exact functionality as their PowerShell counterparts.
Refer to other parts of this manual to see all the different usage options for PowerShell version 
and then simply adopt executing bash scripts instead.

Example of running the editor
```
# PowerShell usage
.\cm-editor.ps1 -iwad DOOM2.WAD -nomonsters -warp 1

# Bash usage
./cm-editor.sh -iwad DOOM2.WAD -nomonsters -warp 1
```

And now running the player
```
# PowerShell usage
.\cm-player.ps1 load test.cman -iwad DOOM2.WAD -nomonsters -warp 1

# bash usage
./cm-player.sh load test.cman -iwad DOOM2.WAD -nomonsters -warp 1
```

As you can see, it should be simple enough to switch to the bash version if needed.

Huge thanks to [m0rb](https://github.com/m0rb) for the implementation!
