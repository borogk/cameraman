# Chapter 6 - For developers

This chapter is for those who wish to modify and recompile the **Cameraman** mod.

You might have noticed - this mod sources don't exactly follow [ZDoom mod structure](https://zdoom.org/wiki/Using_ZIPs_as_WAD_replacement).
That's because the mod consists of two modules:
1. `CameramanEditor.pk3`
2. `CameramanPlayer.pk3`

These two modules share most of the code, so in order to not make redundant copies, a special build script takes care of picking necessary files and assembling resulting PK3 archives.

### Prerequisites

1. ACS compiler must be installed
    - Download from [here](https://zdoom.org/downloads)
    - Make sure path to `acc` binary is available in `PATH`
2. PowerShell 5.1+ should be installed (if you want to use `build.ps1` script)
   - Windows 10 and above should have it pre-installed
   - For other OS and older versions of Windows [see the installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)

### How to build

The project's build script is `build.ps1`. Here's how it works:
1. ACS scripts from `src/acs` are compiled by [acc](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ACC) to get corresponding `.o` submodules
2. `CameramanEditor.pk3` consists of:
    - everything from `src/acs/editor`
    - every compiled `.o` (put into `acs` subfolder)
    - `LICENSE` file
3. `CameramanPlayer.pk3` consists of:
    - everything from `src/acs/editor`
    - `player.o`, `geometry.o`, `common.o` (put into `acs` subfolder)
    - `LICENSE` file
4. Result `CameramanEditor.pk3`, `CameramanPlayer.pk3` and helper PowerShell/bash scripts from `src/ps1`/`src/bash` are put into the `out` folder
5. `LICENSE` file is also put into the `out` folder

All of this can be done by hand or write your own non-PowerShell script if you like.

### (Q) "Can I use the source code in my project?"

**Yes!** Feel free to explore the source code and copy anything you like. This mod is designed for standalone usage, 
but you can take it apart and embed portions of it into your own work.
