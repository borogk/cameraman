# Appendix A - List of CVARs

Following CVARs control the camera behavior and are present in both Editor and Player modules:

| CVAR        | Default | Description                                               |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| cman_path_mode | 0 | **Path mode** (0 for Linear, 1 for Radial, 2 for Bezier) |
| cman_speed_mode | 0 | **Speed mode** (0 for Distance, 1 for Time) |
| cman_angle_mode | 0 | **Angle mode** (0 for Relative, 1 for Absolute) |
| cman_delay | 0 | Amount of gametics to delay before engaging the camera. Works in the Player module only, but may be set and exported in the Editor. |
| cman_speed | 1.0 | **Speed** value |
| cman_x0 | 0.0 | **X0** value |
| cman_y0 | 0.0 | **Y0** value |
| cman_z0 | 0.0 | **Z0** value |
| cman_x1 | 0.0 | **X1** value |
| cman_y1 | 0.0 | **Y1** value |
| cman_z1 | 0.0 | **Z1** value |
| cman_x2 | 0.0 | **X2** value (exclusive to Bezier mode |
| cman_y2 | 0.0 | **Y2** value (exclusive to Bezier mode) |
| cman_z2 | 0.0 | **Z2** value (exclusive to Bezier mode) |
| cman_a0 | 0.0 | **A0** value |
| cman_a1 | 0.0 | **A1** value |
| cman_p0 | 0.0 | **P0** value |
| cman_p1 | 0.0 | **P1** value |
| cman_ra0 | 0.0 | **RA0** value (exclusive to Radial mode) |
| cman_ra1 | 0.0 | **RA1** value (exclusive to Radial mode) |
| cman_cx0 | 0.0 | **CX0** value (exclusive to Radial mode) |
| cman_cy0 | 0.0 | **CY0** value (exclusive to Radial mode) |
| cman_cx1 | 0.0 | **CX1** value (exclusive to Radial mode) |
| cman_cy1 | 0.0 | **CY1** value (exclusive to Radial mode) |
| cman_r0 | 0.0 | **R0** value (exclusive to Radial mode) |
| cman_r1 | 0.0 | **R1** value (exclusive to Radial mode) |
| cman_overshoot | 0 | When set to _True_, camera makes a smoother transition on the last gametic, but may go a little beyond the path end point |
| cman_warp_player | 0 | When set to _True_, player constantly warps along with the camera, this option may trigger specific map actions dependent on player position |
| cman_hide_player | 0 | When set to _True_, player model is hidden during the camera playback |

Following CVARs tweak the Editor module, be careful when changing them manually:

| CVAR        | Default | Description                                               |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| cman_editor_cursor_distance | 50.0 | Distance between the player and the cursor (works when the cursor is not locked) |
| cman_editor_cursor_sensitivity | 10.0 | Step, by which the cursor distance is adjusted |
| cman_editor_linear_path_resolution | 10.0 | Distance between dots in Linear path preview |
| cman_editor_radial_path_resolution | 0.01 | Angular distance between dots in Radial path preview |
| cman_editor_bezier_path_resolution | 100.0 | Amount of dots in Bezier path preview |
| cman_editor_path_animation_delay | 2 | Controls pace at which path preview is animated (bigger number means slower pace) |
