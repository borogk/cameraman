# Chapter 4.4 - Point and shoot mode

_**Note** - make sure you've read [Chapter 4.1 - Linear mode](ch04.01.linear.md) first! It explains a few base concepts which won't be explained here._

**Point and shoot** mode provides a simplified method of creating [linear](ch04.01.linear.md) camera paths.

Rather than using a cursor and manually adjusting the angles, it automatically captures position and aiming angle of
the player at two points and then interpolates between them.

### Defining parameters

This mode uses the same parameters as the Linear mode. Most of them are captured from the player POV, such as:
- **X0, Y0, Z0** position is taken from the player's start point
- **X1, Y1, Z1** position is taken from the player's end point

### Camera angle and pitch

- **A0, P0** are taken from the direction where the player was looking at the start
- **A1, P1** are taken from the direction where the player was looking at the end
- **Absolute** angle mode is engaged automatically

**Note** - A0 and A1 are auto-adjusted to select the shortest turning arc. 
If you meant to turn the longer way, manually change the angles.

### Drawing interactively

To draw in a "point and shoot" mode, follow these steps:
1. Make sure the draw mode is set to `Point and shoot`
2. Position yourself at the starting point and press `[Use cursor]`
3. Move yourself to the end point and press `[Use cursor]` again

This would make a linear path between the two captured points. See example pictures below.
