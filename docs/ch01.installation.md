# Chapter 1 - Installation

**Cameraman** mod works on [ZDoom](https://zdoom.org/) family of source ports. 

Note that even though this documentation references **GZDoom** specifically, the mod should work on other ports from the family (such as LZDoom and older ZDoom). 

Having said that, the latest version of **GZDoom** is definitely recommended.

### Installation

1. Download the latest build [here]() and extract the ZIP. Here's the contents you should expect:
```
CameramanEditor.pk3
CameramanPlayer.pk3
editor.ps1
player.ps1
settings.ps1
LICENSE
```

2. Make sure you have PowerShell 5.1+ installed.
   - Windows 10 and above should have it pre-installed
   - For other OS and older versions of Windows [see the installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)

3. Check `settings.ps1` file and put the path to your ZDoom executable of choice:
```powershell
# By default, the mod seeks Windows GZDoom executable in $PATH 
$GzdoomPath = 'gzdoom.exe'  
```
4. Start the mod via `editor.ps1` with arguments specifying IWAD and level:
```
.\editor.ps1 -iwad doom2 -warp 1
```

In Linux / OSX use `pwsh` to run the script:
```
pwsh editor.ps1 -iwad doom2 -warp 1
```

_**Note** - every command line example in this manual will assume Windows. If you use other OS - adjust the command accordingly._

5. If everything went right, you should see the level with mod interface loaded:

Congratulations! Now we can start using the mod.
